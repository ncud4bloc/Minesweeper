# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game for Odin Project

I tried to make this close to the classic game in terms of functionality and appearance

Additional updates pending:

When a "0" box is clicked on, do vertical and horizontal sweeps for further "0" elements using a function similar to
the zocCalc function but without diagonal calculations.

May also include optional board sizes and number of mines
